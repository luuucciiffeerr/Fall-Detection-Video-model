# Video-Based Fall Detection using Anomaly Detection

This repository will contain a research-oriented implementation of a **fall detection system based on video anomaly detection**.

The core idea is to model *normal human activities* in video sequences and detect falls as **rare abnormal events**, rather than treating fall detection as a standard supervised classification problem.

At this stage, the project is **not implemented yet**. This repository currently serves as a starting point and design placeholder.

## Project Goal

The main objective of this project is to explore whether fall detection can be effectively formulated as an **anomaly detection problem** using video data.

Key motivations:
- Falls are rare and diverse events
- Labeled fall data is often limited
- Anomaly detection allows training primarily on normal activity

---

## Planned Approach (High-Level)

The planned system will likely include:
- Video-based temporal modeling of human motion
- Learning normal activity patterns from video sequences
- Detecting falls as deviations from learned normal behavior

Specific models, datasets, and architectures are **not finalized yet**.

## Current Status

- Project structure: **not finalized**
- Model: **not implemented**
- Dataset: **not selected**
- Training pipeline: **not implemented**

Development has **not started yet**.

## Scope

This project is intended for:
- Academic research
- Experimentation with video anomaly detection
- Non-medical, non-critical applications

It is **not intended** for clinical or real-world safety-critical deployment.
